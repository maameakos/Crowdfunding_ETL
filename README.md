# Crowdfunding_ETL
For the ETL mini project, we work on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. We transform the data, and created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
